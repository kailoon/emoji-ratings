# emoji-ratings
Mini Weekly challenge from Scrimba.

## Instruction

You job is to enable users to give a rating between 1 (bad) and 5 (great), 
and then display that rating in the form of an emoji. The users should give 
their ratings by pressing a key on their keyboards (the numbers 1 to 5). 
Here's the numbers' corresponding emojis:

5 = 😁
3 = 🙂
3 = 😐
2 = ☹️
1 = 🤬

Hints: event listeners, keyboard events, key codes, 
focus, focusout, DOM manipulation, tabindex
